# HackerRank Data Structures Solutions
HackerRank is an online platform that offers programmers the ability to test their
sills, practice and learn something new. 

The problem sets on HackerRank are divided in Domains and the following are the domains
on HackerRank:

1. [Algorithms](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms)
2. [Data Structures](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures)
3. [Mathematics](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/mathematics) 
4. [C](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/c)
5. [C++](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp)
6. [Java](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java)
7. [Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python)
8. [Ruby](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/ruby)
9. [Linux Shell](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/shell)
10. [Functional Programming](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/fp)
11. [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/ai)
12. [SQL](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql)
13. [Databases](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/databases)
14. [Regex](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/regex)

This repository contains solutions to the Data Structures domain part of HackerRank. My
HackerRank profile can be viewed [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/anishviewer).

The Data Structures Domain Falls under a broader Problem Solving Skill Set in HackerRank
which consists of both 
[Data Structures](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures) 
and [Algorithms](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms).

The Data Structures Domain is further Divided into the following sub-domain. All
problems in this domain have been solved with the Java programming language.

I have also solved other domains on HackerRank that can be viewed at:
