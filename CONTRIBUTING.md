# Contributing Guidelines

This project aims to create a common source for all Data Structure questions on HackerRank and values every single 
contribution made by the community.

We aim to solve all questions in the HackerRank Data Structures domain in as many languages as possible to show the 
different code styles and approaches that can be used to solve the same problem.
 
Contributing is very simple. Simply identify a question from the [README](README.md) file that has yet to be solved in
a programming language of your choice. 

Solve that question and make sure that all tests pass on HackerRank and then create a pull request with the 
added solution and updated readme.
  
  
## Style Guide
We wish that other people and understand and learn from the cde that is given in this repository, 
hence code that is legible, properly indented with good function names and variable names, with clear
flow that makes understanding the algorithm easy will be highly appreciated.

The submitted code must also pass all test cases of the given problem on HackerRank (obviously 😉).
Happy Coding 🐱‍👤   
  
  
## Pull Request Process

1. Fork this repository to your github account and then clone your forked repository to your machine.
2. Say you solve some problem called __Rita & Stacks__ in the _Stacks_ sub domain on 
    HackerRank using your favorite programming language, say Python then simple add a new file called 
    `rita-and-stacks.py` in the `stacks` directory. 
3. In the [README](README.md) file, add a Python logo along with an empty link.
4. Updating the link for the solution will be done by the Project maintainers (aka. [anishLearnsToCode]())


## Programming Language Logos
To add a logo in the [README](README.md) table simply add a link with an embedded picture as 
```markdown
[![Python](icon-link)](this link will be filled by the author if the pull request is accepted)
```

For the icon link refer to the table below to obtain the link for a specific programming language:
